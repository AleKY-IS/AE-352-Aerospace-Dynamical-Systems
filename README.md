Aerospace Dynamical Systems

The code in this repo represents my working code in AE 352 taught by Professor Bretl in Fall of 2015.

All code framework was written by Professor Bretl while only dynamical equations of motion, thruster locations, simulation results and params definitions were me where a simulation exists. Programs without simulations are from me. I have permission from Professor Bretl to post this content. 


For homeworks 3-n, the simulation videos can be seen on my youtube channel at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7b1d0UPj4rQghUsh_rI1sA
